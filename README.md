# Description
This is the final assignment for the Bakend Developer Capstone Course of the Meta Backend Developer Professional Certificate on Coursera.
<br> <br>

# Project Structure
The project is composed of two apps, `api` and `restaurant`. The `api` app serves API endpoints of the project, while the `restaurant` app serves its frontend. The `config` (the project folder) directory holds the major settings of the project
<br> <br>

# Installation

install the dependencies
```jsx
pipenv install
```

Activate the virtual environment

```jsx
pipenv shell
```
<br>

# Setup
The default database settings are

```jsx
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'littlelemon',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
        'USER': 'admin',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'",
        },
    },
}
```
ðŸ’¡ Change those settings according to your local setup.
<br>
<br>

Apply the migrations
```jsx
python manage.py migrate
```
<br>

# Environment Variables
For authenticated API requests in the view of the restaurant app, a username and password must be provided. Follow the instructions bellow <br>

Inside the restaurant app folder, create a file called .env and place the code inside it
```jsx
USERNAME=yout_username
PASSWORD=your_password
```
<aside>ðŸ’¡ replace "your_username" and "your_password" with a valid username and password respectively</aside>

<aside>ðŸ’¡ Be aware that `django-environ` must be installed for this to work. Such dependency should be installed by running `pipenv install`</aside>
<br> <br>

# API Endpoints
The `api` app has a total of 4 endpoints. Additionally, `Djoser` and `SimpleJWT` endpoints are available.
<br>

Each endpoint requires a SimpleJWT Token for authorization. Pass the token in the header of the request such as
```jsx
{'Authorization': 'JWT <token>'}
```
<br>

In Insomnia, add the token as follows

# Testing
There are a total of 12 tests to ensure that each API endpoint and each of its allowed HTTP methods work properly.
<br>

Run the tests
```jsx
python manage.py test
```
<br>

It should output something similar to this
```jsx
Found 12 test(s).
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
............
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 12 tests in 6.024s

OK
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
```
<br>

<aside>ðŸ’¡ These tests intrinsically test the `restaurant` models by creating entries on its database through the Django ORM.</aside>
